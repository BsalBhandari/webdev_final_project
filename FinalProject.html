    <h1>Some Key Characteristics of Blockchain</h1>
    <p>
        Blockchain is like a digital ledger that allows people to securely store and share information without the need for a
        middleman or central authority.

    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column">
            <h3>Decentralization</h3>
            <p>Blockchain is a decentralized system, which means that there is no central authority controlling it. Instead, it is run
            by a network of nodes, each of which has a copy of the blockchain.</p></div>
            <div class = "column">
            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>Blockchain is a transparent system, which means that all participants in the network can see the same information.</p></div>
            <div class = "column">
            <h3>Immutability</h3>
            <p>Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.</p></div>

    <h1>Blockchain in Finance</h1>
    <p>Sure, here's some content about blockchain in finance:
    
    Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing greater security,
    transparency, and efficiency</p>
    <div class ="row">

            <img src = "img/blockchain10.jpg">
            <h3>Digital currencies</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum use blockchain technology to create a decentralized, digital currency that
            can be sent and received without the need for intermediaries like banks. This has the potential to reduce transaction
            costs and increase financial inclusion, especially for people who don't have access to traditional banking services.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="main2-col"> 
            <img src = "img/blockchain11.jpg">
            <h3>Cross-border payments</h3>
            <p>Blockchain can be used to facilitate cross-border payments by providing a faster, cheaper, and more secure way to
            transfer funds. This is because blockchain technology allows for near-instant transactions without the need for
            intermediaries, which can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with traditional cross-border payments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="main2-col"> 
            <img src = "img/blockchain9.jpg">
            <h3>Stock trading</h3>
            <p>Blockchain can be used to facilitate stock trading by creating a more efficient and secure way to transfer ownership of
            stocks. This is because blockchain technology can create a tamper-proof and transparent record of all stock
            transactions, which can help reduce the risk of fraud and errors.</p>

    <h1>Blockchain in Healthcare</h1>
    <p>Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by enabling secure, transparent,
        and efficient data sharing between different stakeholders such as patients, providers, payers, and researchers.

            <h3>Medical Records Management</h3>
            <p>Blockchain can help manage electronic medical records (EMRs) by providing a secure and decentralized
                platform for storing and sharing patient data. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses, faster
                treatment, and better patient outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Drug Supply Chain Management</h3>
            <p>Blockchain can be used to track the entire lifecycle of a drug, from manufacturing to distribution to
                consumption, ensuring that drugs are authentic, safe, and not counterfeit. This can help reduce drug
                fraud, waste, and abuse.</p>

        <div class="main2-col">
            <img src="img/blockchain8.png">
            <h3>Clinical Trials</h3>
            <p>Blockchain can improve the transparency, integrity, and efficiency of clinical trials by enabling secure
                and decentralized data sharing among different stakeholders such as patients, providers, and
                researchers. This can help accelerate the development of new drugs and therapies.</p>
